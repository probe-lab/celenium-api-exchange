  description: |
    The ProbeLab API offers endpoints for retrieving detailed network 
    metrics.

    This API loosely follows the [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).
    This means, all successful responses will only have a `data` field
    containing the payload. All error responses will only have an `error` field
    containing at least a `message` field with an error description. Following
    the style guide, if there are multiple errors the `error` object will
    contain another `errors` array.

      description: |
        This endpoint returns statistics about the given Celestia network. Check
        the different path and query parameter documentation below. The maximum
        number of data points that this endpoint returns is `512`. The number of
        data points is derived by dividing the `start` and `end` time range
        by the `interval` duration. This is an arbitrary limitation and if
        you need different limits, let us know.
        
        This default data points granularity is 1h and the minimum is 10 minutes.

            with the API we will be better able to identify the cause.

            The aggregation of interest.
            
            In the future we plan to support:
            
            - `protocol` - The `columns` field in the response will protocol strings like `/ipfs/id/1.0.0` or `/celestia/header-ex/v0.0.3`
            - `datacenter` - The `columns` field in the response will contain names of datacenters that peers are hosted in like `Amazon`.
            - `isDatacenter` - The `columns` field in the response will just contain `true` or `false`.
            
            We don't give a guarantee for the above. Especially `protocol` seems of low interest so we might drop that.

          description: |
            The UTC aggregation start timestamp. In combination with the `end`
            query parameter, this endpoint will only return the aggregation of
            peers that were seen in the network within the time range spanned by
            both timestamps.
            
            If this query parameter is not provided the API will return all peers
            that were seen up until 24h before the `end` timestamp (which is set
            to `now` by default).
            
            Note that the timestamp will be rounded down to the nearest multiple
            of `interval` which is set to 3600 seconds (1h).

            You can provide timestamps as defined by [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)
            in the format `2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00`. You can omit the timezone
            part `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z` (the `Z` suffix indicates UTC).

            The `start` and `end` times will be rounded down to a multiple of 
            `interval` (since the beginning of the unix epoch).
            
            For example, the a start or end timestamp of `2024-12-07T12:15:36`
            with an interval of `1h` will be truncated to `2024-12-07T12:00:00`.
            
            Further, the time range spanned by start and end will be divided
            into `interval`-sized chunks in which the aggregation happens.
            
            The value needs to be a multiple of the minimum interval size of
            600 seconds (10 minutes).

                          data points for such an early time. It just indicates

                          given timestamp is rounded down to the nearest multiple

                          the `start` timestamp, we exchange both values. This
                          timestamp also never matches the last timestamp in
                          the `index` array. The last timestamp in the array
                          corresponds to the last bucket of the aggregation until
                          the `end` time. Therefore, the last timestamp in the
                          list is usually `interval` seconds earlier than this
                          `end` timestamp. If the `end` timestamp is in the
                          future the difference of the last timestamp in the
                          index array and this `end` value is larger accordingly.

                          statistics this will contain timestamp strings in the

                          statistic we can have values for multiple node types
                          at each timestamp. This `columns` array will contain
                          an ordered list of node types. The ordering corresponds
                          to the values array of arrays below.
                          
                          In the case of the `version` statistic this array will
                          contain a lexicographically sorted list of valid semver
                          strings.
                          
                          In the case of the `country` statistic this array will
                          contain [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
                          alpha-2 codes like `US`, `GR`, or `FR`. There are two
                          special cases that will also appear in this array
                          which are `unknown` and `multi`. The former means that
                          we were not able to map a certain peer to a country
                          and the latter means that we saw a peer connecting from
                          multiple countries.
                          
                          In the case of the `city` statistic this array will
                          contain geohash+city name combinations formatted like
                          `$geo_hash,$city_name`. Note that there can be
                          multiple different geo hashes for the same city name.
                          There are two special cases as in the `country`
                          statistic. This array may also contain entries that
                          correspond to unknown and multiple locations of peers.
                          These will appear in the resulting array as
                          `s00000000,multi` and `s00000000,unknown`
                          respectively. `s00000000` corresponds to the lat/long
                          values of `0`, `0`.
